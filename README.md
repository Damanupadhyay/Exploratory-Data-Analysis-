# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-
PowerCo, a major gas and electricity company, is losing customers to other energy providers. They need  help in figuring out why. With so many energy options available now, it's crucial to understand why customers are leaving. We'll dig deep into the data to understand why customers are leaving and how we can prevent it.


### Problem Statemant:

PowerCo, a major gas and electricity utility, is facing a significant challenge as customers are leaving for other energy providers, known as customer churn. To address this issue, PowerCo has needed help  to identify the reasons behind this trend. Given the evolving energy market landscape with increasing customer choices, understanding and mitigating churn has become paramount.

### Approch:
This data science project aims to analyze customer churn at PowerCo by conducting a deep analysis of factors contributing to churn. The project involves preprocessing customer data to ensure its quality and conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and trends that may explain customer behavior. Through statistical analysis and visualization, the project seeks to provide insights that will help PowerCo develop strategies to reduce churn and retain customers.
